# Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to delve into the intricacies of game development using pixel art and the pygame library in Python.

## Development Process

Throughout the project, I followed a guided approach by referring to video tutorials on YouTube. This involved modifying existing code and introducing new elements such as maps and characters to customize the implementation.

## Key Steps

1. **Research and Learning**: Initial exploration of pygame and pixel art concepts.
2. **Video Reference**: Utilizing YouTube tutorials as a guide for development.
3. **Code Modification**: Adapting and enhancing the provided code for a personalized touch.
4. **New Elements Addition**: Incorporating original maps and characters to enrich the game.

# Project Files

The project repository contains the following key files:

- `main.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `maps/`: Folder containing various map files.
- `characters/`: Folder housing character-related assets.

# How to Run the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JackHuyn/RPG_Game_Project

2.  Navigate to the project directory
    cd Test/code

3. Run game the script
    run python main.py
